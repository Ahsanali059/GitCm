Git work of hashing 
git use graph data structure 
git store the data in key value pair formate 
                  key =>Hashing 
                  Value=>actual data 
It used crptographic hashing algorithm called SHA1 
It store the data in hexadecimal formate 


1)git rm --cached <filename> moves files back to working area to staging area 


2)git restore =>it removes all files changes from the statging area to be commited This can be usefull if we did some distry place of code and now to no more wnt it.Instead of deleting every changes line by line,we can restore it or you can say restore last clean version of the file 

3)To Restore All Files:
git restore .

4)Restoring Files from a Specific Commit  

git restore --source=<commit> <file>

5)Discarding Changes in working directory 

git restore --source=HEAD --staged .

-------------------------------------->git restore<------------------------------------------
6)restore from working area 
git restore fileName
7)restore from statging area 
git restore --staged <filename>
                     =>this will come to the working area from the stataging area 
                     =>my last stataging area code come to the working area 

8)Diff between git rm and git restore 

ans:if we want to move the whole file back to untracked state,then we do git rm,otherwise if we just want the changes to me moved to working area or statging area then we use git restore

9)if we went to see the difference of between to version(commits)

git diff firstCommit secondComit 

10)git commit (vim editor open for commit message)

11)git remote =>it list down all the remote 

12)git remote rm <remoteName> this command will delete the remote connection 

13)git remote rename <oldname> <newName>   =>this command rename the remote connection 

14)How to send files there are untrack files 

git stash --include-untracked 

15)git stash with tag meaning full name 
git stash save "login data with jwt tag"

16)commit amend 
git commit --amend "updated message"
